## we will have lots of problem with high Dimensionality!
Imagine dropping a penny on a straight line the length of the football field. How long would it take you to find it.
Now, imagine dropping that penny on a football field. How long would it take you to find it?

Now, imagine dropping that penny within a three dimensional space the size of a football field. How long would it take you to find it.
The difficulty of searching through the space gets a *lot* harder as you have more dimensions. You might not realize this intuitively when it's just stated in mathematical formulas, since they all have the same "width". That's the curse of dimensionality. It gets to have a name because it is unintuitive, useful, and yet simple.

# AS much as the dimensionality increase, the need of data to generalize accurately the problem exponentially increase!
## see my provieded code to understand better the problem in Python Notebook.
